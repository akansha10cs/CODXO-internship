# JAVA PROJECTS 

# 1) NUMBER GUESSING GAME

# 2) CURRENCY CONVERSION 
This code allows the user to select a currency to convert INR to (Euro, US Dollar, British Pound, Japanese Yen, or Australian Dollar), then prompts them to enter the amount in Indian Rupees (INR). After entering the amount, it calculates and displays the converted amount in the chosen currency based on predefined conversion rates.

# 3) ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
This code uses a HashMap to store student records with their IDs as keys. Provides a menu-driven interface to add students, mark attendance, and display attendance records.The program runs in a loop, offering the user a menu to perform different operations until they choose to exit.

# 4) ONLINE QUIZ MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
This code provides a basic framework for an Online Quiz Management System. It includes the definition of a Question class to represent each quiz question, a Quiz class to hold a collection of questions, and the main class OnlineQuizManagementSystem to orchestrate the quiz-taking process. In this simplified version, the quiz questions and options are predefined, and the user selects their answers by entering the corresponding option letter. The system then evaluates the answers and provides a final score at the end of the quiz.
